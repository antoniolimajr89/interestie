Interestie
==========

A simple application that receives a post and records who was interested in what.

GET - yep, get :( - with a jsonp callback parameter to have your function invoked with either ok or errors set. Remember to pass both parameters:

interest[email]=user_email
interest[item]=item_the_user_is_interested_in

Success example:

your_callback( ok : 'ok');

Failure example:

your_callback( errors : 'unable to set up interest');
